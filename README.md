# Word Invader
A cute word search game where a little alien must find words to abduct villagers

This game is an open source game. It is completely free, and contains no ads or in-app purchases.

The premise is simple: Search for words by dragging a line between the available letters.

This game is similar to many other word search games, but does away with advertisements and other distractions. The board is randomly generated, and continues infinitely.
